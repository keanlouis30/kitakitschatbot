What makes KitaKits stand out isn't just its utility‚Äîit's the real-time, anonymized data it collects on:
- Grassroots consumer behavior

## üéØ Problem Statement

There is a lack of granular, real-time data on food consumption patterns, demand forecasting, and supply chain dynamics at the microenterprise level. 

### Current Data Challenges:
- Most data available to suppliers, governments, and researchers are **outdated, top-down, or limited to formal markets**
- Micro and small food retailers‚Äîover **1.2 million strong**‚Äîserve as the pulse of the Philippine consumer economy
- According to PSA's 2023 data:
  - MSMEs make up **99.63%** of establishments
  - Micro-enterprises alone constitute **90.43%**

### The Opportunity:
By embedding a useful but simple tool (KitaKits) into their daily operations, we gain access to organic, real-time data about:
- What people buy
- What expires
- What moves

This information is highly valuable to decision-makers in logistics, FMCG, food security policy, and local economic development‚Äîmaking KitaKits both a **community tool** and a **data intelligence platform**.

KitaKits bridges this divide by capturing store-level behaviors in a format that's accessible, intuitive, and invisible to the user‚ÄîMessenger chat.
